        1. Can the products having stored temperature between 2 º to 8º C (35 º to 46 º F) be transported in enviroment temperature?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    Yes. They can be transported in temperature between 15 to 30º C (59 to 86 F) even for 72 hours with no compromise of the products quality and must be stored between 2 a 8º C (35 to 46 F).
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        2. How can Bioclin Biochemical line controls must be stored?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    Bioclin biochemical controls (Biocontrol N y Biocontrol P) are commercialized as freeze-dried (lyophilized) and must be kept in such conditions of refrigeration between 2 to 8 º C. After reconstitution they can be split and frozen ensuring greater stability of the product. In case being kept under refrigeration after the product reconstitution they will present a lesser period of stability*.

        1. Which are the impacts generated from improper water use during laboratory execution?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    It’s imperative the constant monitoring of water quality to be used in the labs because the impacts brought by the use of non-purified water can release wrong results due to the dosage interference and even damage the used equipments.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        2. Does Bioclin have kits to evaluate the quality of water used during the laboratory reactions?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    Yes. Bioclin owns the Purified Water kit which is simple, quick and practical helping in the physical-chemical evaluation of wáter. Testing Acidity, Alkalinity and Organic Substances in addition to the Silicate kit which determines qualitatively dissolved silicate through colorimetric reaction.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        3. Is the Purified Water kit accepted by Health Surveillance?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    Yes. It’s a kit developed according to the pharmacopoeia methodology and exempted from ANVISA registration

    <b>
        1. Some Bioclin products present a padron, can the same padrons be applied as internal control?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    No. Padrons are calibrators performing totally different functions. Their function is to dermine the analytes concentration in samples with known values rather than the controls used with the purpose of quality control, checking the stability and reproductibility in the conditions of common use which can present two levels (normal or pathological) and mustn’t be used for calibrators
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        2. How often do the kits should be calibrated?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    The kits should be calibrated at every batch change. In case controls don’t present a good performance in the dosage outcomes (after the assessment of that need) or whenever needed.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        3. Should Biocontrol N and Biocontrol P controls be used simultaneously?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    Yes. The controls have different testing levels. The Biocontrol N analytes concentrations represent normal parameters and Biocontrol P represent the pathological parameters.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        4. Is it possible to obtain the values of the dosage of the proficiency essays controls through Bioclin?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    No. The results obtained by the dosage of the proficiency essays controls proficiency are interlaboratories and obtained in independent way not being allowed the disclosure of the results findings, that is, each lab should report its outcome.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        5. Does Bioclin own controls for coagulation line?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    Yes. Nowadays Bioclin has two levels of control for coagulation line (TTPA, TP and Fibrinogen) making possible the assessment of normal coagulation by means of Coagulation Biocontrol N and patological Coagulation Biocontrol P.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        6. Does Bioclin own controls for assessment of the haematological equipments performance?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    Yes. Bioclin has two kind of controls to monitor the automatic haematological analyzers performance, being them Hemato 3P Biocontrol and Hemato 5P Biocontrol.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        7. Can Bioclin Haematologic controls be used in equipments not comercialized by Bioclin?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    No. The haematologic controls only have value for the equipments used by Bioclin.

    <b>
        1. What’s the difference between the dedicated kits and the kits with ordinary presentations?
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    The dedicated kits have their exclusive use aimed at a given automation Bioclin equipment. It’s worth remembering the same reactive is present in both presentations; however the dedicated kit will make easier the reactive reposition process during the routine for being conditioned to an exclusive bottle of equipment used in addition to avoiding some pre-analytical mistakes.
